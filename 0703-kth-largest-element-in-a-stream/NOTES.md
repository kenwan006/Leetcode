/** Heap
* Initialize a min heap of the capacity k. Keep adding the val to the heap, the top item is always the smallest as well as kth largest in the heap
* Eg, k = 3, nums = [4, 5, 2, 8], the initial heap = [4, 5, 8], 4 is the smallest as well as 3rd largest in the heap;
* Adding a new item 6 to the heap, pop out 4, then it becomes [5, 6, 8], so 5 is the smallest as well as the 3rd largset in the heap...
* Remember all the items smaller than the kth largest item are poped!
