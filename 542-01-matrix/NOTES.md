- BFS
- No need to check the cell 0 because it's nearest to itself; for the noo-zero initialize them to be MAX_VALUE and then update them every time we check it.
- Add the unchecked cell to a queue, and check all the neighbors for each cell. If the neighbor will be updated with smaller value, then we have to add this neighbor to the queue for further check.
