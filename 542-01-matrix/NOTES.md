BFS
- No need to check the cell 0 because it's nearest to itself; for the noo-zero initialize them to be MAX_VALUE and then update them every time we check it.
- Add the unchecked cell to a queue, and check all the neighbors for each cell. If the neighbor will be updated with smaller value, then we have to add this neighbor to the queue for further check.

DP is faster and less space needed
In DP, we can only use prevous values if they're already computed.
In this problem, a cell has at most 4 neighbors that are left, top, right, bottom. If we use dynamic programming to compute the distance of the current cell based on 4 neighbors simultaneously, it's impossible because we are not sure if distance of neighboring cells is already computed or not.
